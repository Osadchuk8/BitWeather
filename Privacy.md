## Privacy Policy

### What information is collected.
BitWeather uses your geographic location in order to get weather information from the forecast server. 

### How it is used.
The App uses your geo position data to request and provide weather information for your location.
Once weather data is requested, geo location data is dismissed. Your geo position is not recorded, tracked or saved in any manner.
 
### Personal information and BitWeather.
BitWeather does not collect personal information. According to latest personal data protection regulations and norms, the data is considered to be personal, if it allows to identify the user. The geographic location used by BitWeather (kilometer precision), does not allow to identify the actual user, and thus can not serve as personal data.
