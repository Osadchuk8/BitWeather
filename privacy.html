<h4  align=center>This Privacy Policy covers use of the BitWeather app.</h4>
  
<p><b>Collection and Use of Personal Data.</b></p>

  <p><b> What information is collected.</p></b>
<p>BitWeather uses your geographic location in order to get weather information from the forecast server. Your position is mesured with "kilometer precision", which is just enough to figure out what city are you currently located in.  </p>
  
  <p><b> How it is used.</p></b>
<p>The App uses your geo position data to request and provide weather information for your location.
Once weather data is requested, geo location data is dismissed. Your geo position is not recorded, 
  tracked or saved in any manner.</p>
  
 <p><b>Other Personal Data.</b></p>
 <p>
 	Bitweather does not collect or use any other kind of personal data.
